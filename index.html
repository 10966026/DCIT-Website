  <h1>Dolphins</h1>
 </header>
 <body><p><b>Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals and are part of the family of toothed whales that includes orcas and pilot whales.</b>

They are found worldwide, mostly in shallow seas of the continental shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. Dolphin coloration varies, but they are generally gray in color with darker backs than the rest of their bodies.</p>
<p>
As climate change causes the seas and oceans to warm, dolphins are being seen more frequently in colder waters outside their historic ranges. Due to rapidly rising ocean temperatures, dolphins primary food sources are seeking deeper, cooler waters. Scientists are concerned that dolphins will have difficulty adapting as quickly as necessary to find new feeding grounds to sustain their populations..
Some dolphins that live in areas where rivers and oceans meet, known as brackish waters, are also losing habitat as ocean levels rise due to global warming. </p>
<p><b>Defenders' Impact</b><br>
Defenders fights any attempt to weaken the Marine Mammal  Protection Act and all the protections it affords marine mammals  like dolphins.</p>

<p>Defenders serves as a conservation member of the Bottlenose  Dolphin Take Reduction Team, a stakeholder group  convened under the MMPA to advise the National Marine  Fisheries Service on how to reduce fisheries bycatch of this  species. We are currently litigating to challenge seismic  blasting in the Atlantic Ocean that risks harming and  killing thousands of dolphins. </p>

<p>We are also opposing offshore oil and gas development in the  Arctic and Atlantic, and working to promote wildlife- and whale-friendly best management practices for offshore wind siting and development.</p>
